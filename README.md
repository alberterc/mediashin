Graphics User Interface of a few FFmpeg and FFprobe functions on Windows 10.

Inspired by my laziness on using CLI for FFmpeg or FFprobe everytime I need to check details, convert, or compress video files.

## Installation
1. Download and install a version of Mediashin from the [release](https://github.com/alberterc/mediashin/releases) page.
2. If Mediashin tells that it can't find FFmpeg or FFprobe, you should download them first from the [FFmpeg's website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). After downloading, don't forget to include them in your system's PATH environment.
3. Done! Thank you for downloading!
